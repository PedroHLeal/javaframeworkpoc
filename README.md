This is just a simple POC to better understand how a JAVA framework architecture is implemented using reflections.

It doens't open any ports, but the idea is to be able to create APIs and exception handlers by just creating the files.

Example classes:
  - src/api/MyEndpoint.java
  - src/returnhandlers/MyReturnHandler.java
